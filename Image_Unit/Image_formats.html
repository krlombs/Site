    <br>
    <center><h2>PNG</h2></center>
    <center><p>PNG stands for Portable Network Graphics.  This filetype has no compression, so it loses no detail, and it was originally designed to replace the GIF filetype</p></center>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h2>JPEG</h2></center>
    <center><p>JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Groups.  This filetype has compression, so it tends to lose detail the more it is saved, although the loss in detail isn't very noticable.<br>JPEGs are ideal for cameras and that is where they are most often used</p></center>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h2>GIF</h2></center>
    <center><p>GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  This filytype has no compression, although it only allows the use of 256 colors.  Another special quality of this filetype is that the file can be animated.</p></center>
